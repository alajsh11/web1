  Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security
  algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.
  Introduced as part of the original 802.11 standard ratified in 1997,
  its intention was to provide data confidentiality
  comparable to that of a traditional wired network.[1] WEP,
  recognizable by its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits
  (40 or 104 bits), was at one time widely in use and was often
  the first security choice presented to users by router
  configuration tools.
