<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
avaScript is a programming language commonly
used in web development.
It was originally developed by Netscape as
a means to add dynamic and interactive elements
to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by
Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based
on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
